# kahoot-gui
A GUI for a simple Kahoot spammer. Not affiliated with Kahoot.

## How it works
Uses `Electron` and `kahoot.js-updated`

To be honest I'm not actually sure how it works. It just does.
## Usage
Download it and install all the dependencies and stuff (or just download the release version, unzip it and run kahoot-gui.exe)

The name input will be the base name for your bots.

The pin is the code displayed on the host's screen.

The number of bots is the number of bots.

"speed i am speed" is the time in milliseconds between each bot join.

Once everything is filled in, press the "yeet" button once.

Inside of the console, you can see basic information coming from each bot. (eg. joined, disconnected, left, answered ect)

The console can be shown or hidden through the toggle show button.

"show quiz infos" will open up a menu that will get populated with information about the quiz once it starts.

"kill bot spawner" will stop bots from spawning 
~~(useful if you accidently typed 10000 bots or something and your about to kill your internet but you still want to use my epic kahoot thing)~~
